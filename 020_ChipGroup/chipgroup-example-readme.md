## Code Overview

### MainActivity.kt

This file contains the main logic for handling ChipGroup interactions and demonstrating various ChipGroup and Chip functionalities.

Key points:
- Sets up ChipGroups with different configurations
- Demonstrates how to add and remove Chips programmatically
- Shows how to handle Chip selection and deselection

### activity_main.xml

This layout file defines the UI of the app, including various ChipGroups and Chips with different styles and attributes.

### strings.xml, colors.xml

These files contain resources for text and colors used by the ChipGroups and Chips.

### custom_chip_background.xml

Defines a custom drawable for Chip background.

### AndroidManifest.xml

This file declares the main activity and sets up basic app properties.

## Notes

- This example demonstrates various ways to use ChipGroups and Chips. In a real-world application, you would typically choose a consistent style and behavior for Chips throughout your app.
- ChipGroups are particularly useful for displaying a set of choices or filters in a compact and user-friendly way.
- Remember to handle Chip interactions appropriately in your app's logic.
