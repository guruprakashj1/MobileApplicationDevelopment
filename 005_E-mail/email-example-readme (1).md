## Features

- Email input field with Material Design
- Real-time email validation
- Submit button to demonstrate form submission
- Display of validation result

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the source files.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## Code Overview

### MainActivity.kt

This file contains the main logic for handling user input and validating the email address.

Key points:
- Uses TextInputEditText for email input
- Implements real-time email validation using a TextWatcher
- Uses Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS for regex-based email validation
- Displays validation result on button click

### activity_main.xml

This layout file defines the UI of the app, including:
- TextInputLayout with TextInputEditText for email input
- A submit button
- A TextView for displaying validation results

### AndroidManifest.xml

This file declares the main activity and sets up basic app properties.

## Notes

- This is a basic example of email validation. In a production app, you might want to implement more sophisticated validation or use a library.
- The email regex used (Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS) is generally reliable but may not catch all edge cases. Consider your specific requirements when choosing a validation method.
- Always validate emails on the server-side as well, as client-side validation can be bypassed.
