## Code Overview

### MainActivity.kt

This file contains the main logic for handling FAB interactions and demonstrating various FAB functionalities.

Key points:
- Sets up different types of FABs
- Demonstrates how to handle FAB click events
- Shows how to animate FABs
- Illustrates coordination between multiple FABs

### activity_main.xml

This layout file defines the UI of the app, including various FABs with different styles and attributes.

### strings.xml, colors.xml

These files contain resources for text and colors used by the FABs.
