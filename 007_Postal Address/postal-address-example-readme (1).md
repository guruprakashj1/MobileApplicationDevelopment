## Features

- Input fields for different parts of a postal address (street, city, state, ZIP code, country)
- Material Design TextInputLayout for each field
- Basic validation for each field
- Submit button to demonstrate form submission
- Display of validation result

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the source files.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## Code Overview

### MainActivity.kt

This file contains the main logic for handling user input and validating the postal address.

Key points:
- Uses TextInputEditText for each address field
- Implements basic validation for each field
- Displays validation result on button click

### activity_main.xml

This layout file defines the UI of the app, including:
- TextInputLayout with TextInputEditText for each address field
- A submit button
- A TextView for displaying validation results

### AndroidManifest.xml

This file declares the main activity and sets up basic app properties.

## Notes

- This is a basic example of postal address input and validation. In a production app, you might want to use more sophisticated validation or integrate with an address verification API.
- The validation rules are simple and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements and target countries.
- Consider adding features like address autocomplete for a better user experience in a real-world application.
