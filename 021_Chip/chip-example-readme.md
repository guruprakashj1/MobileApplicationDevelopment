## Code Overview

### MainActivity.kt

This file contains the main logic for handling Chip interactions and demonstrating various Chip functionalities.

Key points:
- Sets up different types of Chips
- Demonstrates how to handle Chip interactions (click, close, check/uncheck)
- Shows how to create and customize Chips programmatically

### activity_main.xml

This layout file defines the UI of the app, including various Chips with different styles and attributes.

### strings.xml, colors.xml

These files contain resources for text and colors used by the Chips.

### custom_chip_background.xml

Defines a custom drawable for Chip background.

### AndroidManifest.xml

This file declares the main activity and sets up basic app properties.

## Notes

- This example demonstrates various ways to use and customize Chips. In a real-world application, you would typically choose a consistent style and behavior for Chips throughout your app.
- Chips are versatile components that can be used for selections, filtering, or as compact elements to display information.
- Remember to handle Chip interactions appropriately in your app's logic.
