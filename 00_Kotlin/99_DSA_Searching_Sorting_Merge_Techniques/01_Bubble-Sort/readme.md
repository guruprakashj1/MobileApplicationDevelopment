# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Concept
- Compare each pair of adjacent elements from the beginning of an array and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
- Repeat this process for each element in the array.
- After each iteration, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n) - when the array is already sorted
- Worst Case: O(n^2) - when the array is reverse sorted
- Average Case: O(n^2)

## Use Cases
- Educational purposes to understand sorting algorithms
- When simplicity is more important than efficiency
- When the input size is small

## Advantages
- Simple to understand and implement
- Requires no additional memory space

## Disadvantages
- Very inefficient for large lists
- Performance is poor compared to more advanced algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort
