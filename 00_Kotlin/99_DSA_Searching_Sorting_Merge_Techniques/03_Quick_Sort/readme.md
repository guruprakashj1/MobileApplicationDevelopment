# Quick Sort

Quick Sort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements.

## Concept
- Choose a 'pivot' element from the array.
- Partition the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
- Recursively sort the sub-arrays.

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n^2) - when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element
- Average Case: O(n log n)

## Use Cases
- General-purpose sorting
- When average-case performance matters more than worst-case performance
- Systems concerned with virtual memory and paging

## Advantages
- Very efficient for large datasets
- In-place sorting (requires little additional memory)
- Works well with virtual memory

## Disadvantages
- Unstable sort (doesn't preserve the relative order of equal elements)
- Worst-case time complexity of O(n^2)
- More complex to implement than some other algorithms
